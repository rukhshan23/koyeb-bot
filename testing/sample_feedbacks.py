  "0": "This is a great paper.",

  "2": "TwIPS introduces a much-needed intervention for autistic users struggling with text-based interactions. The authors highlight critical challenges and provide a strong evaluation framework. The presenter maintained a professional and confident demeanor, but the discussion could have benefited from more audience engagement. Further exploration of AI bias and user reliance would deepen the research’s impact.",

  "3": "This research contributes meaningfully to accessibility by leveraging AI to enhance digital communication for autistic individuals. The presenter's feedback was thorough and well-articulated, though at times a bit fast-paced, making it slightly difficult to follow certain technical details. A broader evaluation beyond the lab setting would strengthen the paper’s findings and applicability.",

  "4": "The authors present a well-structured study on TwIPS, a texting tool designed to aid autistic users with conversational clarity. The presenter's feedback was insightful and professional, though they could have allowed more time for discussion. Future work should consider the double empathy problem from both neurodivergent and neurotypical perspectives to foster a more inclusive communication model.",

  "5": "TwIPS is a thoughtful and innovative prototype that balances AI assistance with user autonomy. The presenter provided clear and encouraging feedback, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, a more interactive Q&A segment could have made the session more engaging. Investigating long-term user reliance on AI mediation could add depth to the discussion.",

  "6": "The paper effectively showcases how AI can assist autistic users in deciphering tone and intent in text communication. The presenter delivered feedback in a structured and respectful manner, although at times, more emphasis on critical challenges could have improved the depth of discussion. Future iterations of TwIPS could explore personalization strategies to align AI-generated messages more closely with user preferences.",

  "7": "The study on TwIPS is well-executed, with a robust user study highlighting its effectiveness. The presenter's feedback was balanced, addressing both strengths and areas for improvement. However, the pacing was slightly rushed, making it harder to absorb nuanced arguments. Exploring how TwIPS could integrate with mainstream messaging platforms would provide further practical insights.",

  "8": "TwIPS presents an important step toward AI-assisted communication for autistic individuals. The presenter was respectful and engaging, but the feedback could have been more specific in addressing potential limitations of the approach. Investigating trust calibration mechanisms for AI-generated suggestions would help refine the system’s real-world usability.",

  "9": "This work provides valuable insights into AI-mediated interventions for autistic users. The presenter delivered feedback in a professional and structured manner, effectively summarizing key points. However, a more critical analysis of TwIPS’ potential over-reliance on LLMs would have been beneficial. A longitudinal study assessing TwIPS’ effectiveness over time would strengthen its real-world impact.",

  "10": "TwIPS offers a compelling approach to AI-assisted communication for autistic users, demonstrating clear benefits in enhancing text-based interactions. The presenter conveyed the key ideas with clarity and professionalism, making the discussion engaging and well-structured. However, the evaluation could be expanded to explore potential limitations, such as user reliance on AI-generated suggestions and how this affects long-term communication habits. Incorporating a broader participant pool and real-world deployment data would further solidify the study’s contributions."

#This paper presents TwIPS, an LLM-powered texting application aimed at simplifying conversational nuances for autistic users. The study effectively demonstrates how the tool helps users interpret tone, preview message impact, and refine phrasing. The presenter's feedback was clear and engaging, showing a solid grasp of the study’s goals. However, while the study is well-structured, incorporating feedback on potential real-world deployment challenges would enhance its depth.
